We'll be interacting with our code in two ways

1. With the classic text editor + terminal combo, for writing and running scripts, and
2. With Jupyter notebooks, for multimedia and interactive output

Run the command below to start your Jupyter notebook server.
`nohup jupyter notebook --allow-root --NotebookApp.token='' --NotebookApp.password='' > /dev/null 2> /dev/null &`{{execute}}

Then, click [here](https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-8888-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/)
to open your Jupyter notebook server.

You can also click the tab that says "Jupyter" at the top of your terminal
to reconnect to the server if you ever disconnect.
